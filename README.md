This is a simple web application that allows users to search for a location by entering an address. The application then utilizes the Google Geocoding API to fetch the coordinates of the entered address and displays it on a map.

## Getting Started

To use this web app, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have an API key for the Google Geocoding API. If you don't have one, you can obtain it from the Google Cloud Platform Console.
2. Replace `YOURAPIKEY` in the script tag within the `index.html` file with your actual API key.
3. Save your actual API key in a configuration.js file
4. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Features

- **Address Search:** Users can enter an address into the input field and search for its location.
- **Dynamic Map:** The application dynamically displays the location on a map using the Google Maps API.
- **Error Handling:** If the entered address is not found or if there's an error in fetching the location, appropriate error messages are displayed.
